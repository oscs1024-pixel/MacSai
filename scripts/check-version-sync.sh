::error::VERSION ($VERSION_FILE_VALUE) and MCConstants.appVersion ($SWIFT_CONSTANT_VALUE) drift.

Both must be bumped together. The release pipeline reads VERSION to
name the DMG and tag the GitHub release; the app's title bar reads
MCConstants.appVersion. If they don't match, users see a different
version in the title bar than what brew installed — exactly the kind
of "did I actually upgrade?" confusion the constant exists to solve.

Fix:
  - Edit VERSION (current: $VERSION_FILE_VALUE)
  - Edit Sources/MacCleanKit/Constants.swift's appVersion (current: $SWIFT_CONSTANT_VALUE)
  - Make them equal.
